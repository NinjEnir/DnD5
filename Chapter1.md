Chapter 1 - Living and Dying
====

__HP__:

As usual, your hitpoints cannot drop below 0.  If you would take damage that would bring you to 0 or less you are knocked _unconcious_ and must begin making _death saving throws_.

Optionally, if you take damage that would bring you to 0 or less you can opt to take a wound instead.  When you take a wound in this fashion, the ammount of damage negated determines the severity of the wound.

__Wounds__:

Wounds grant permanent exhaustion as long as you have them, this exhaustion doesn't have to be rested away before you begin healing.

* Minor Wounds - 1 exhaustion
* Moderate Wounds - 2 exhaustion
* Major Wounds - 4 exhaustion

The severity of a wound is determined by the ammount of damage it negated when you took it.

* Less than 8 Damage - Minor wound
* Between 8 and 44 damage - Moderate Wound
* Greater than 44 damage - Major wound

To heal a wound, you must spend a number of days in an extended rest equal to the ammount of damage it negated.  If the extended rest is interrupted, your progress on that wound persists and will resume when you enter another extended rest.

If you have unhealed, untreated wounds and engage in strenuous activity - there is a chance that they will become more severe.  Minor wounds may rise to moderate wounds, moderate wounds may raise to major wounds - fortunately major wounds can't get any worse!  This chance is 50%, and is rolled at the end of the encounter with strenuous activity.

__Exhaustion Levels__:

Various activities, monster abilities, and injuries will grant you exhaustion levels.  When you have exhaustion, it must be rested away before you begin feeling the effects of rest.  Each long rest removes one point of exhaustion. For example, if you have 2 points of exhaustion from pushing yourself, and you've used up all your hit dice, you won't gain any back from resting for the first two nights.

1. You're tired
2. Really tired
3. You can't maintain _concentration_
4. Disadvantage on _saves_
5. Disadvantage on all _ability checks_ and _attack rolls_, others have advantage against your spell and ability saves
6. _Move speed_ is halved, and when casting a spell you must succeed a DC 8+Spell level _constitution check_ or the spell fizzles (resources are still expended)
7. _Move speed_ is reduced to one quarter normal, if you attempt to move you must make a DC 10 constitution check or fall to the ground.  You cannot have more than half your _hitpoints_.
8. _Move speed_ is reduced to 0, you may take only one _action_ (_Action_, _Reaction_, _Bonus Action_) per _round_ regardless of other abilities.
9. You are _unconscious_.  Your maximum hitpoint value is 0.
10. You are _dead_.

__Resting__:
Resting now follows this timeline with the following rewards for resting:

Short rest - 1 Hour - You get back any abilities that say they come back on a short rest, and you can spend any number of hit dice to gain (# spent x (Die roll + Con mod)) hitpoints back.  If you have any minor wounds that require attention, you can use a medical kit to bandage them and help prevent them from becoming more severe.  Once bandaged, wounds only have a 1% chance of opening from strenuous activity.

Long rest - 8 hours with at least 6 hours of sleep - You regain any powers that come back on a long rest, you gain the benefits of a short rest. If you are in safe, comfortable surroundings with food and drink you regain 1/2 of your hit dice (rounded down).

Extended rest - At least 7 days in safe, comfortable surroundings with ample food and drink - You regain all your missing hitpoints, all your missing hit dice, heal all exhaustion (except that from wounds),  and as long as you remain in an extended rest you heal wounds 2 days faster per week.  An extended rest is interrupted by ANY combat, strenuous movement, ability usage, spellcasting, etc - and must be restarted from the beginning.
