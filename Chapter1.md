Chapter 1 - Living and Dying
====

__HP__:

As usual, your hitpoints cannot drop below 0.  If you would take damage that would bring you to 0 or less you are knocked _unconcious_ and must begin making _death saving throws_.

Optionally, if you take damage that would bring you to 0 or less you can opt to take a wound instead.  When you take a wound in this fashion, the ammount of damage negated determines the severity of the wound.

__Wounds__:

Wounds grant permanent exhaustion as long as you have them, this exhaustion doesn't have to be rested away before you begin healing.

* Minor Wounds - 1 exhaustion
* Moderate Wounds - 2 exhaustion
* Major Wounds - 4 exhaustion

The severity of a wound is determined by the ammount of damage it negated when you took it.

* Less than 8 Damage - Minor wound
* Between 8 and 44 damage - Moderate Wound
* Greater than 44 damage - Major wound

To heal a wound, you must spend a number of days in an extended rest equal to the ammount of damage it negated.  If the extended rest is interrupted, your progress on that wound persists and will resume when you enter another extended rest.

__Exhaustion Levels__:

Various activities, monster abilities, and injuries will grant you exhaustion levels.  When you have exhaustion, it must be rested away before you begin feeling the effects of rest.  Each long rest removes one point of exhaustion. For example, if you have 2 points of exhaustion from pushing yourself, and you've used up all your hit dice, you won't gain any back from resting for the first two nights.
