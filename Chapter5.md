Equipment Management

Each player is given a folder or plastic pocket to keep their character, exp card, and items in.

When a player is awarded an item, it will be given to them on a notecard - and as long as that player has the notecard, their character has the item.  The only exceptions are money, ammunition, and supplies such as foodstuffs, which can be tracked on a single notecard, or multiple notecards.

If a notecard is damaged, destroyed, or lost, the item (or items) in the game world are treated the same.
