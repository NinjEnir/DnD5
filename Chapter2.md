Experience and Leveling
====

__Experience__:
  
Experience is no longer awarded per the base rule set.  Instead, players are awarded experience points after particularly difficult encounters - combat or otherwise.

Normal Encounter - 0 Experience
Hard Encounter - 1 Experience
Deadly Encounter - 2 Experience
Ludicrous Encounter - 3 Experience
Mini-Boss - +1 Experience
Arc-Boss - +2 Experience

No experience is received for encounters where the characters don't learn anything, where they weren't threatened, or there was no risk.  Partial experience may be awarded for failed encounters, or encounters reaching a less than desireable outcome.

To level up, you need a number of experience points equal to the level you're moving to (or 4, whichever is higher).  Experience points are tracked on a separate notecard - to be kept in your character folder's notecard slot.  You must spend at least a long rest to gain the benefits of leveling up.  You may defer leveling if desired, but you can't overlevel (your experience is frozen 1 below what is required for the next level).
