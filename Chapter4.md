Flanking and Facing
====

During combat, each character faces a particular direction - denoted by a dot in their square on the map.  The facing determines three zones which affect sight and advantage for most creatures.  Creatures with All around vision, blind fighting, blind sense, and other types of perception may have different zone layouts - as would completely blind or senseless creatures.  These zones are the defaults.

Zone 1 - Creatures in this zone are the ones you can pay attention to.  They are never granted advantage by flanking, but they can grant others in zone 2 flanking.
Zone 2 - Creatures in this zone are in your peripheral vision.  You can see that they are there, but paying attention to them in combat would require changing your facing.  They receive advantage on attack rolls against you as long as they aren't the only combatant.
Zone 3 - Creatures in this zone are in your blind spot.  They always receive advantage, and can count attacks as a sneak attack for any abilities they might have.
