Pushing Yourself
====

Sometimes you really need something to happen, bit it's just beyond the rules - just beyond what you can do.  In these cases you can push yourself to do it anyway, at a cost.  Each time you push yourself you gain 1 Exhaustion level.  There are 10 levels, detailed in the first chapter.

Here are some examples of pushing yourself:

* Hruuhg the Orc barbarian is fighting many puny kobolds and wants to swing his sword through groups of them instead of targeting individual kobolds, spreading his damage out evenly between several targets.  He pushes himself to do it during this fight - and becomes exhausted afterwards.
* Timaa the Elvish assassin wants to run just a little faster as her recently botched assassination has brought the wrath of King Argondas' guards down upon her.  She pushes herself to gain an extra 5ft of movement speed, and becomes exhausted after a minute of running - having just barely managed to evade capture by hiding in a crate the guards didn't see her get into.
* Grundar the Dwarven cavalier isn't adjacent to his ally when an arrow whizzes towards her - He wants to dive to block it with his shield but he doesn't have any abilities to do so.  He pushes himself to heft his heavy body into the path of the arrow, blocking it with his defensive abilities - and becomes exhausted from the physical strain.
* John the cowardly wizard finds himself incapable of casting spells in the presence of others, so instead he pushes himself to circumvent the limits of the Glyph spell - allowing it to stick to items even after they are moved from their location.  Doing this exhausts him, and he does have other work to do, so he doesn't have a large stock of these magically endowed items.
